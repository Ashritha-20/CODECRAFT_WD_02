OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
project:RESPONSIVE LANDING PAGE
objective:The objective of this project is to design and implement an interactive, fixed-position navigation menu that enhances user experience by:

Providing constant access to navigation links at the top of the page.

Improving readability and visibility through dynamic style changes when the user scrolls.

Offering interactive feedback with hover effects on menu items.

Highlighting the active section while scrolling, ensuring users know their current position on the page.

This makes the website more user-friendly, professional, and visually engaging
TECHNOLOGIES USED:
***HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

Provides the structure of the webpage.

Used for creating the navigation bar (<nav>), menu items (<ul><li><a>), and content sections (<section>).

***CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

Adds styling and design to the webpage.

Used for fixed positioning of the navbar, background colors, hover effects, transitions, and active link highlighting.

***JavaScript (JS)
Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Detects scroll position, changes the navbar background when scrolling, and highlights the active menu item based on the section currently in view.
CONCLUSION:
This project successfully demonstrates the development of an interactive fixed navigation menu using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The menu enhances the usability and user experience of a webpage by remaining visible at all times, dynamically changing its appearance when scrolling, and providing visual feedback through hover effects and active section highlighting.

Overall, the project showcases how simple web technologies can be combined to build a professional, responsive, and user-friendly navigation system, which is a core component of modern web design.
